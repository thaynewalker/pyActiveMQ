6/2020 -- Fix code and build for python3 - T Walker

=====================

This is a python wrapper around the ActiveMQ-CPP library ("CMS":https://activemq.apache.org/cms/).

To install pyactivemq you need to download "ActiveMQ-CPP":https://activemq.apache.org/components/cms/download/395-release
and unzip it to your @/opt@ folder.

Then go to the folder and type:

<pre>
sudo python3 setup.py install
</pre>

This will compile and install the pyactivemq library into your python environment.
